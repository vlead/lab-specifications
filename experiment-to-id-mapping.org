* Introduction
  This document maps an experiment id to an experiment name. 

* Assignment

     Rules for assigning an experiment id to an experiment
     1. ExperimentId = starting with "e" letter followed by a 5 digit numeral.
     2. The experiment ID started with 99999 number and every experiment ID is generated by 
        decrementing this number by 1.
     3. For a new experiment, the experiment ID is decided based on the 5 digit last number reached by decrementation. The new ID would be 1 less than the last experiment ID generated.
